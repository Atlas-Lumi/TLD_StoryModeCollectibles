# What items are added?
Everything shown in the screenshot, plus a few more. Almost all story mode items have been included, except for keys and notes.
Even currently unimplemented items such as the Fireaxe and Shovel have been added.

A list of `GEAR_` names can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Atlas-Lumi/TLD_StoryModeCollectibles/wiki)

# Where to find them?

The collectibles are more-or-less where they would be in story mode. They are fairly easy to find and aren't hidden at all.

- Mountain Town 
  - Grey Mother's house, Plane Crash Site, Milton Park

- Pleasant Valley 
  - Farmstead, Signal Hill, Thomson's Crossing, The Church

- Blackrock
